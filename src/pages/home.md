# Hey, I'm Matthew <span class="wave">👋🏻</span>

I'm a front-end web developer with over a decade of experience working with client bot in the UK & abroad. I am based in Oxfordshire, but can also work remotely, servicing the entire country.

In my spare time, I’m often found exploring the wilderness with my trusty drone, either that or I’m shut in a dark room playing video games raging at the clicker that just killed me in the Last of Us.

If you have an upcoming project you'd like to discuss then please [get in touch](contact.html).
